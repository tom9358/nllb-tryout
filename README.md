# NLLB Gronings Tatoeba Translation Machine

This project focuses on building a translation machine for the Gronings language using the Tatoeba dataset and the NLLB (No Language Left Behind) model.

I'm working on this in my free time so the project does not always have steady progress.


Special thanks to [CmdCody](https://huggingface.co/CmdCody/) for the very similar and very inspirational project for North Frisian, and for the link to a useful blogpost.

Thanks to the nice blogpost [How to Fine-Tune a NLLB-200 Model for Translating a New Language](https://cointegrated.medium.com/how-to-fine-tune-a-nllb-200-model-for-translating-a-new-language-a37fc706b865) for helping me get started and helping with some parts of the code.

Thanks to [tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/) for being a platform that has Gronings, for letting me add and correct sentences there in many languages, and for providing the parallel corpus datasets that I can use for this project.
